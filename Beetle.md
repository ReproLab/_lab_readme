:shit: Reprolab beetle SOPS :shit:

Step 1: Make the bait (AKA Dungpling) and prepare trap materials:
Materials
Your poop
Gloves
Ziplocks 
Spoons
Dung container
Breathable cotton cloth
Cotton Twine (not too thick)
Scissors (“dirty”, used to cut anything that is in contact with poop)
Satay stick
Corrugated plastic boards
Dungpling container

Preparing materials
Cut corrugated boards into squares of 15 X 15 cm, and puncture holes with satay sticks near to each corner of the square, as well as one right in the center (5 holes total).
When preparing for fieldwork, each corrugated board shelter should be paired with 4 satay sticks at least, but always prepare extra of everything.
How to make each dungpling:
Cut cloth into sheets about 20 X 20 cm.
Break satay sticks into quarters (snap in half, and snap each half in half). Each dungpling will need one fragment of satay stick.
Place a heaped tablespoon of dung in the center of the cloth, and bring the corners of the cloth together.
Tie the corners together with a twine, and with one excess end of the twine, tie a satay stick fragment about 3-4cm away from the dungpling, and cut off any excess twine.
Keep dungplings in an airtight container (like tupperware) and keep in the fridge until needed to be brought outfield. Double bag tupperware in ziplocs before heading out to keep the smell in. 

Step 2: Set up the baited pitfall traps
Materials
Corrugated board shelters (15 by 15cm)
Shovels
Mallet (to hammer shovel into really hard ground)
Root scissors
Cups (5.5 diameter, 13 cm height, purchased from Japan home)
Signs
Satay sticks
Water
Marking tape (to mark trees so you don’t get lost)

OR Arboreal trap
Materials

Setting up baited pitfall traps
Find a suitable location: no ants, flat ground, no roots, got canopy cover BUT not too far from QGIS coordinates
Use a shovel to dig a hole in the ground → can start by digging down on four sides of a square and digging up the soil
*pro tip* use a mallet to hammer the shovel into hard ground, but be careful of the angle of the shovel if not the shovel might break
Put the cup in the hole so that the brim is up to the soil surface
Stick 4 satay sticks into the 4 corners of the corrugated board.
Take out the dungplings and push the stick through the hole in the middle of the corrugated board so that the dungpling can hang from it
Add water to the cup so that it is about ¼ full
Stick the makeshift shelter into the ground so that the hanging dungpling is positioned directly above the mouth of the cup
Place a leaf so as to cover the rainfall so rain won’t go through the hole and wet the dungpling
Take a photo of the trap with location services on! Save GPS coordinates
Tie marking tape around a nearby tree so as to mark where the trap is




Step 3: Collect environmental parameters (if applicable)
pH/% moisture probe
Soil temperature probe
Densiometer
Thermo-hygrometer
Transect tape



Step 4:  collect your loots
Materials
Gloves 
50ml falcon tubes
Round plastic container (e.g. those used to contain soya beancurd) + lid with holes (small enough such that beetles dont escape)
Plastic sieve (for large qty of beetles within 1 trap)
Forceps (preferably blunt so it’s easier to grab the beetles and not accidentally poke through their bodies)
Marker
Tape (to label the containers - try not to label directly onto the containers as it is hard to wash off/ might be confusing as containers are being reused)
Zip lock (to pack the trap)

Collecting baited pitfall traps
Remove the makeshift shelter
Carefully lift the cup from the hole
Pour its contents through a white round sieve over the ground
Use forceps to quickly pick up the beetles and put them into a plastic container
Discard non-beetles and put them back on the ground
Every time you put a beetle into the plastic container, cover it with a lid quickly
Once everything is inside the container, label it with the trap number using masking tape
Disassemble the makeshift shelter and put the components into the “dirty” ziploc bag
Throw the dungpling back into the hole and cover it up with leaves and twigs
Take down the marking tape from the nearby tree

Methods





Processing the collected beetles
Using forceps, transfer the beetles from the plastic containers into a Falcon tube filled with 70% ethanol. They will drown and die. Feel sad.
Stick the Falcon tubes into the -40 freezer and wait for a while until the beetles are dead for sure

# Sigma RNAzol RT Total RNA Isolation


Step 1: Homogenize tissue samples in 400ul RNAzol RT using a Polytron or other appropriate homogenizer. Add another 600ul RNAzol RT and mix.

Step 2: Add 0.4 mL of RNase-free water. Cover the sample tightly, shake vigorously for 15 seconds, and allow to stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge the resulting mixture at 12,000×g for 15 minutes at 4-28 °C. Transfer 750ul supernatant to a new tube.

Step 3: To 750ul supernatent add an equal volume of 100% isopropanol to precipitate RNA. Allow to stand for 10 minutes then centrifuge at 12,000×g for 10 minutes at room temperature. (The RNA precipitate will form a white pellet on the bottom of the tube). Wash RNA pellets with 0.5 mL 75% ethanol (v/v). Centrifuge at 4,000-8,000 ×g for 1-3 minutes at room temperature.
Repeat wash second time.
Remove alcohol solution with a micropipette.
Solubilize the RNA pellet, without drying, in Rnase-free water at a concentration of 1-2μg/mL for mRNA and 0.1 μg/μL for micro RNA. Vortex the samples at room temperature for 2-5 minutes.
