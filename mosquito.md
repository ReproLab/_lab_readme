# Mosquito Guides and Protocols

## 1. Useful references<br>

- [Mosquito Taxonomic Inventory](http://mosquito-taxonomic-inventory.info/)

Set up by Dr. Ralph Harbach of the Natural History Museum, this website provides up-to-date information on mosquitoes including classification, bionomics, distribution and disease relations. It also recommends useful references and has an [anatomical glossary](http://mosquito-taxonomic-inventory.info/node/11027) if you are not sure of the specific parts of the mosquito

- [Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU)](https://www.wrbu.si.edu/)

The Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (Smithsonian Institution) houses the world's largest mosquito collection. The website also includes interactive identification keys, sampling protocols and other resources.

- [Mosquito Catalog](http://mosquitocatalog.org/)

The mosquito catalog set up by WRBU has not been maintained since 2016, but it is still very useful for searching for information by species name or distribution. You can also use it to search for taxonomic papers relevant to a particular species.
The catalog is currently being transferred to a new website, and this link will be updated accordingly by then.

## Sampling Protocol

## Rearing protocol 
Stage codes:
- Larvae 1st to 2nd instars : U
- Larvae 3rd instars: L3
- Larvae 4th instars: L4
- Pupa : P
- Adult : A

Check for:
- 4th instars
  - If not sure, look for exuviae
  - Label with L4 + date
- Pupa
  - Label with P + date
- Adults
  - Transfer to dry container
  - Transfer old label (including L4, P date) + A + emerging date 
  - E.g. KR3-L4 
         P-15/8 
         A-20/8
- Dead larvae/pupa:
  - Pick up with metal scoop(flat side) into ethanol in individual eppendorf tubes
  - Shift to middle before scooping to prevent damage
  - Alternatively, pipette onto scoop
Split each 3rd, 4th larvae and pupae into their own containers at the start (2 vials + rubber band) and label

Cleaning:
- Water too cloudy
- Excessive algae (clean last/separate pipette)
- Excessive uneaten food 
- Worms/nymphs
- Molts
- Rinse pipette with RO water in a vial per mosquito vial? Good idea!

Feeding:
- Larvae only, not pupae
- Crush food with cap 
- Sprinkle dry food on surface w/o water for anopheles (larvae parallel to water surface)
- Pour into vial with RO water 
- Feed suitable amount with food pipette, do not dip into mosquito vial water
