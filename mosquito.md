# Mosquito Guides and Protocols

## 1. Useful references<br>

- [Mosquito Taxonomic Inventory](http://mosquito-taxonomic-inventory.info/)

Set up by Dr. Ralph Harbach of the Natural History Museum, this website provides up-to-date information on mosquitoes including classification, bionomics, distribution and disease relations. It also recommends useful references and has an [anatomical glossary](http://mosquito-taxonomic-inventory.info/node/11027) if you are not sure of the specific parts of the mosquito

- [Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (WRBU)](https://www.wrbu.si.edu/)

The Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit (Smithsonian Institution) houses the world's largest mosquito collection. The website also includes interactive identification keys, sampling protocols and other resources.

- [Mosquito Catalog](http://mosquitocatalog.org/)

The mosquito catalog set up by WRBU has not been maintained since 2016, but it is still very useful for searching for information by species name or distribution. You can also use it to search for taxonomic papers relevant to a particular species.
The catalog is currently being transferred to a new website, and this link will be updated accordingly by then.
