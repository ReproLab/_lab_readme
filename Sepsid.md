Culture maintenance
-------------------
Most of our live cultures are of _Sepsis punctum_ , and are kept within S2L1 Insectary - “Scavenger Research 2”

   ### Stock maintenance ###
   ####   Location of essentials in Insectary: ####
   - Sugar = “ Microscope room”, large plastic tub beside squeeze bottles of water
   - (tap)Water = “ Microscope room”, squeeze bottles beside sugar container
   - Vial and cap = “Microscope room”, toyogo container beside Insectary clock
   - String = Stationary holder beside blue drawers
   - Cattle dung = “Teaching Facility 2” near the washing sink, within box labelled “Reprolab box” on lower shelf of fridge (Not Sean’s human dung box!!!)
   - Dung cups/rectangles = “Microscope room”, blue drawers
   
Check cultures every 1-2 days to make sure they're alive and thriving

### Setting up new populations ###
Lab members may sometimes come back from fieldtrips with sepsids to be set up as new populations :smiley: _Always follow the instructions written on individual vials and transfer information (location, date caught, species etc) accurately onto the labels of their new homes._

1. IF: Flies to be set up individually as isofemale lines
2. Flies to be set up together as a single culture



Sexing 
-------------------
- Male behaviour: Butt wiggling and jump onto female which could triggers female struggling (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ifF6DKcnU&list=UUmw6ulUm0VfkP8BUEpAJcjQ&index=1 )

- Male flies abdomen: Generally thinner and more curved (concave) compared to female

- Male flies legs: modified spike forelegs

- Female flies Abdomen: Generally fatter and (convex) compared to male

- Female flies legs: Non-modified smooth forelegs

Dissection 
-------------------
Emerged adults were dissected within one to four days after collection by leaving them in -40 ℃ freezer to induce unconsciousness. Five male flies were taken from each of the four temperature treatments for all 8 replicates and the average sperm size, testes size and head width measurements of five male flies was used as final data for each replicate. To differentiate between male and female flies, Olympus SZX10 microscope was used and flies with modified spiking front legs were identified as males. 

Body measurement
-------------------
Head width of dung flies are often used as indicators of body size due to high allometric coefficient, hence head width was measured physically through Olympus SZX10 microscope. For each adult male fly, both testes were dissected out and placed on separate glass sides with a drop of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) each. Both width (w) and length (l) of testes were measured to calculate the testes size in terms of volume using ellipsoid volume formulation (Volume=1/6 lw^2). Final testes size for each specimen was calculated based on average of two testes. Subsequently, one testis was transferred onto a new glass side with one drop of PBS and teared using insect pin on the proximal end to release the sperms. Sperms were fixed onto a glass slide using methanol and acetic acid mixture in 3:1 ratio for two minutes before being washed with PBS for one minute. Fixed sperm samples were stained using 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution for nucleus identification and subsequently incubated in a dark room for five minutes. DAPI is able to bind specifically onto nucleic acid which enhanced the efficiency of visualization and bioimaging under microscope. Stained sperms were washed with PBS for one minute to remove debris and mounted using five drops of glycerol. A plastic coverslip was laid on the mounted sample before it was sealed with nail polish. For each male fly, length of ten sperms were measured using Image J, and Micro-manager software was used to enhance the picture resolution. Average sperm length was calculated based on ten sperms for each individual fly.

Previous experimental setups
-------------------
   ### Experimental setup for investigation on effect of temperature on sepsid sperm length ###
#Emerged virgins were identified from the main sepsid culture (provided by National University of Singapore Reproduction Laboratory), male and female virgins were isolated into different cages. After collected sufficient virgins (n=20), male and female virgins were released into the same cage to induce mating. Mated virgin pairs were observed and isolated into 100mL tubes. Resources such as sugar, water and dung were provided in the quarantined cage to trigger oviposit for four to six hours. After oviposit, 30 hours was given for the eggs to hatch and 60 first instar larvae were picked up to split equally into four cages. All four cages were given identical amount of dung, water and sugar but incubated with different temperature treatments (16 ℃, 20 ℃, 24 ℃ and 28 ℃) in climate chambers. All climate chambers were checked by Langmuir probes to ensure minimum temperature fluctuation. The cages were monitored daily to observe adult emergence and adult flies were collected immediately upon emergence. The study utilised eight biological replicates for each temperature, which made up a total of 32 cycles of the experiment setup for four populations.
